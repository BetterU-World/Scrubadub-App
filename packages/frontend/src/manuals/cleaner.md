Welcome to ScrubaDub! This manual covers everything you need to know about using the app for your day-to-day cleaning work.

---

## Getting Started

After accepting your invitation and signing in, you'll see your **My Jobs** page. This is your home base showing all your assigned jobs.

## Viewing Your Jobs

Your job list shows all assignments with their status, property name, date, and time. Use the filters to narrow down what you're looking for:

- **Status filter** — Show only jobs with a specific status.
- **Date filter** — Show jobs for today, this week, or all time.
- **Search** — Find jobs by property name.

## Job Lifecycle

Each job follows this workflow:

### 1. Accepting a Job

When a job is assigned to you, you'll receive a notification. Open the job and **Accept** or **Deny** the assignment.

- **Accept** — You're confirming you'll be there.
- **Deny** — Let the owner know you can't take this job (it will be reassigned).

### 2. Confirming the Job

Once accepted, the job status becomes **Confirmed**. This means you're scheduled and the owner is counting on you.

### 3. Starting Work

When you arrive at the property:

1. Tap **Arrive** to log your arrival time.
2. Tap **Start** to begin the job timer.

### 4. Completing the Job

When you've finished cleaning:

1. Open the **job form** for the property.
2. Fill out each section — check off completed tasks, add notes, and upload photos as needed.
3. Tap **Submit** to send the completed job to the owner for review.

### 5. After Submission

The owner will review your submission and either:

- **Approve** — Great work! The job is done.
- **Request Rework** — Something needs to be redone. Check the notes, make corrections, and resubmit.

## Calendar

The **Calendar** shows all your upcoming jobs in a weekly or monthly view. Tap any job to see its details.

## Notifications

You'll receive notifications for:

- New job assignments
- Schedule changes
- Approval or rework requests from the owner

Check the **bell icon** regularly to stay on top of your schedule.

## Tips for Success

- **Accept or deny jobs promptly** so the owner can plan accordingly.
- **Arrive on time** and use the Arrive button to log it.
- **Be thorough with the job form** — complete all checklists and add photos of your work.
- **Read rework notes carefully** if a job needs corrections.
- **Check your calendar daily** to stay prepared for upcoming jobs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I can't make a confirmed job?**
A: Contact your owner as soon as possible so they can reassign the job.

**Q: Do I need to upload photos?**
A: Follow your owner's requirements. Photos help demonstrate quality and protect you in case of disputes.

**Q: How do I see my performance?**
A: Your owner tracks performance metrics. Ask them for feedback if you'd like to know how you're doing.

# Owner Manual

Welcome to ScrubaDub! This manual covers everything you need to manage your cleaning business.

---

## Getting Started

After signing up and creating your company, you'll land on the **Dashboard**. This is your command center showing key metrics at a glance: active jobs, team members, properties, and any open red flags.

## Managing Properties

Navigate to **Properties** to add and manage the locations your team services.

- **Add a property** by clicking "Add Property" and filling in the address, name, and any special notes.
- **Edit or archive** a property from its detail page.
- Each property tracks its job history so you can review past work.

## Managing Employees

Use the **Employees** section to invite and manage your team.

- **Invite a team member** by entering their email. They'll receive an invitation to join your company.
- Assign roles: **Cleaner** or **Maintenance**.
- View each employee's job history and performance metrics.

## Scheduling Jobs

The **Jobs** section is where you create and manage cleaning assignments.

### Creating a Job

1. Click **Schedule Job**.
2. Select a property.
3. Choose the job type: Standard, Deep Clean, Turnover, Move In/Out, or Maintenance.
4. Set the date, start time, and estimated duration.
5. Assign one or more cleaners.

### Job Lifecycle

Jobs move through these statuses:

1. **Scheduled** — Job is created and assigned.
2. **Confirmed** — The assigned cleaner has confirmed they can do the job.
3. **In Progress** — Work has started.
4. **Submitted** — The cleaner has completed and submitted the job for review.
5. **Approved** — You've reviewed and approved the work.
6. **Rework Requested** — You've asked the cleaner to redo part of the job.

You can also **cancel** a scheduled or confirmed job if plans change.

### Reviewing Submitted Jobs

When a cleaner submits a job, it appears in your **Awaiting Approval** count on the dashboard. Open the job detail to review the submitted form, photos, and notes, then choose to **Approve** or **Request Rework**.

## Calendar

The **Calendar** view gives you a visual overview of all scheduled jobs. Use it to spot scheduling gaps or conflicts.

## Red Flags

**Red Flags** highlight issues that need attention — missed items, quality concerns, or client complaints.

- Red flags are created automatically based on job form submissions or can be raised manually.
- Each flag has a **severity** (low, medium, high) and **category**.
- Resolve flags from the Red Flags dashboard once the issue is addressed.

## Performance

The **Performance** page shows metrics for each team member:

- Jobs completed
- Approval rate
- Average rating
- Red flag count

Use this data to identify top performers and areas for coaching.

## Analytics

The **Analytics** section provides company-wide insights:

- Job completion trends
- Revenue tracking
- Property utilization
- Team workload distribution

## Notifications

You'll receive notifications for key events:

- Job confirmations and submissions
- Red flags raised
- Employee invitation responses

Check the **bell icon** or the Notifications page to stay up to date.

## Audit Log

The **Audit Log** records all significant actions in your account for accountability and transparency.

## Tips for Success
